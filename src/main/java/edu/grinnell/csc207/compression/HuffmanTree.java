 * A HuffmanTree derives a space-efficient coding of a collection of byte

 * The huffman tree encodes values in the range 0--255 which would normally
 * take 8 bits.  However, we also need to encode a special EOF character to
 * denote the end of a .grin file.  Thus, we need 9 bits to store each
 * byte value.  This is fine for file writing (modulo the need to write in
 * byte chunks to the file), but Java does not have a 9-bit data type.
 * Instead, we use the next larger primitive integral type, short, to store
 * our byte values.
